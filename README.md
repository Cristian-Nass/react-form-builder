# Encare code test

In this code test you will develop a SPA (Single page application) with the following criteria:

A form builder containing a few common form items such as radio buttons, selects and inputs.
Each form can contain sections of items and as a user I want to be able to edit, move, add and delete.
The items doesn't have to be saved server side so feel free to use a state or state manager.

The form should then be rendered and after being filled in add a submit button where you format the data
in a reasonable way suited for a backend service but just print it in a console.log.

Use as much functionality as possible from material UI when it comes to design.
If needed write some custom css yourself.

Happy hacking!
